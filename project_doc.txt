Directory Structure Generator - Design Document
1. Overview and Purpose
The Directory Structure Generator is a Next.js application designed to help developers quickly create project scaffolding by visualizing, modifying, and generating directory structures. Users can input a directory structure (like the example provided), make modifications through an intuitive UI, and execute the creation of these directories and files in their local filesystem.
2. Features and Requirements
Core Features

Structure Visualization

Parse and display directory structures in an expandable/collapsible tree view
Visual differentiation between files and folders
Support for comments/descriptions alongside structure items


Structure Modification

Checkboxes for inclusion/exclusion of items in final creation
Toggle between file and directory types
Rename files and directories
Add new files or directories at any level
Delete files or directories
Support for drag-and-drop reordering


File Type Detection

Auto-detect file types based on extensions
Interpret items with ** suffix as files (removing the suffix when creating)
Manual override for file/folder designation


Target Location Selection

Directory browser to select parent directory for creation
Option to save favorite locations
Display available disk space at selected location


Execution

Create directories and files based on modified structure
Progress indicator during creation
Error handling for permission issues or disk space limitations
Summary report of created items

Data Flow

User inputs directory structure as text or uploads from a file
Parser converts the text into a tree data structure
UI renders the tree with interactive elements
User modifies the tree through the UI
When ready, user selects target directory and initiates execution
Application creates directories and files through file system APIs
Results are displayed to the user

4. UI/UX Design
Main Layout
The application will use a three-panel layout:
Copy+----------------------------------------+
| Header / App Title / Controls          |
+----------------+-----+------------------+
| Input Panel    |     | Modification     |
| (Text Area)    |     | Panel            |
|                |     | (Node Editor)    |
+----------------+ Tree+------------------+
| Target Dir     | View| Execution        |
| Selection      |     | Controls         |
+----------------+-----+------------------+
|           Status Bar                    |
+----------------------------------------+
Tree Visualization

Expandable/collapsible nodes with intuitive icons
Checkboxes for selection
Color coding for files vs directories
Visual indicators for modified nodes
Drag handles for reordering

Node Editor

Name field with validation
File/directory toggle
Comment/description field
Add child node button (for directories)
Delete button with confirmation

5. Technical Considerations
File System Access

Use the Node.js fs module on the server side through Next.js API routes
Consider using the File System Access API for browsers that support it
Implement proper error handling for permission issues

Security

Validate all user inputs
Implement path traversal protection
Limit access to specified directories only
Consider rate limiting for API endpoints

Performance

Implement virtualization for large directory structures
Optimize tree rendering with React memo and virtualized lists
Consider using web workers for parsing large inputs

6. Future Enhancements

Template library: Save and load common directory structures
Integration with popular project templates (React, Next.js, etc.)
Export/import functionality for sharing structures
Dark/light theme support
File content templating for generated files
Integration with version control systems
Multiple structure comparison view
